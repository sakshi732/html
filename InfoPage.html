Desperate, he goes against the wishes of his former girlfriend turned ex-wife Maya's wishes to recount his own journey in 1992 as a "loser" in a gang of six; as he continues along to convince Raghav, the other five receive news of the tragedy and decide to join their friend in his pain to complete a story they never fail to cherish as a lesson in their life.
