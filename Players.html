                    Suresh Raina[2] (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); born 27 November 1986[3]) is an Indian former international cricketer. An aggressive left-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional off-spin bowler, he is also regarded as one of the best fielders in world cricket. He plays for Uttar Pradesh in all forms of domestic cricket. He was the captain of the Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League, and is the former vice-captain of the Chennai Super Kings.[4] He has also captained the Indian cricket team and is the second-youngest player ever to captain India. He is the first Indian batsman to hit a century in all three formats of international cricket.[5]

Raina made his ODI debut in July 2005 against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. However, his Test debut came about five years later, in July 2010, against the same opposition. He scored a hundred on his Test debut. He was a part of the Indian squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup

On 15 August 2020, Raina announced his retirement from all formats of international cricket,[6] though he will continue to play for Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League but pulled off due to personal reasons for the IPL 2020.

				<article>
                <p style="margin-left: 150px; text-align: center;">
                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is a former Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed explosive middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats. He is widely regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsman and captain in the history of the game. He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.
                    Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district.
                    With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.
                    Dhoni's rise is a rags-to-riches story and has been a one of phenomenal success, punctuated by the occasional blip in performance. Dhoni is the ideal icon for modern India well. Aggression with decorum, modesty along with stardom, and an apparent happy-go-lucky Midas touch, Dhoni is the perfect blend of a role-model and pin-up star.

                <p style="margin-left: 150px; text-align: center;">
                   Ambati Thirupathi Rayudu (born 23 September 1985) is an Indian professional cricketer. He plays as a right-handed middle-order batsman, who occasionally keeps wicket and bowls right-arm off breaks. He plays for Hyderabad in domestic cricket, and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Rayudu began his first-class career with Hyderabad in 2002 at the age of 16 and, by the following year, was playing for India A. He captained the India Under-19 team at the 2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup and was expected to break into the senior team. Disputes with players and state association, followed by signing up with the "rebel" Indian Cricket League, led to him being ignored for national team selection. He returned to domestic cricket in 2009 by accepting BCCI's amnesty offer and terminating his ICL contract. After strong performances for Baroda in domestic cricket and Mumbai Indians in the IPL, he was named in the Indian squad for the first time in 2012. He eventually made his international debut in July 2013, in an ODI against Zimbabwe.

On 2 July 2019, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[1][2] However, on 29 August 2019, Rayudu said that he was willing to play all formats of cricket again.[3]
